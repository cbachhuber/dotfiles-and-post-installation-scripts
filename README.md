# My Ubuntu OS installation script and config files

Tested for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

I suggest cloning this repository to ~/.dotfiles. Though any other location will work as well. Just make sure to not touch the folder after you started relying on the dotfiles in it.

```
git clone git@github.com:cbachhuber/post-installation-and-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
