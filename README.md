# My Ubuntu Post Installation Script and Config Files

Tested for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

I suggest cloning this repository to ~/.dotfiles. Though any other location will work as well. Just make sure to not touch the folder after you started relying on the dotfiles in it.

## Downloading

```
git clone git@github.com:cbachhuber/post-installation-and-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

## Installation

Execute script `setup.sh` in the toplevel folder of this repository

```
.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

You will be asked to enter your sudo password for the apt operations.
